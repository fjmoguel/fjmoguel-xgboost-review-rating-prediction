In this project, I built a classification model to predict Amazon movie review star ratings using XGBoost. 
This model leverages engineered features like review sentiment and mean movie rating, with hyperparameter tuning and SMOTE oversampling to address imbalances. 
I achieved high accuracy in predicting 5-star reviews, while focusing on improving performance for the challenging middle-range ratings. 
Dimensionality reduction and optimized weighting schemes helped balance the modelâ€™s sensitivity across all star ratings.

Final Accuracy was .6309
